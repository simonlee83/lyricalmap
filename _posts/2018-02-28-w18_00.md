#### LAX Spotting
Internet celebrity Tardar Sauce (born April 4, 2012), more commonly known as Grumpy Cat, was spotted peering out a window at the LAX airport. As she turned around, this shot was taken and instant-memed (see below). Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
